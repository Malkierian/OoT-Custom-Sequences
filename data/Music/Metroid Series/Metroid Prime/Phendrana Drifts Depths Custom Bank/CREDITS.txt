SPECIAL THANK YOU to the following folks:

- 	SynaMax on Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/@SynaMax/] for documenting 
	the exact instruments used in the Metroid Prime soundtrack, and being
	gracious with their time and resources in providing information on, and
	sound files for, samples I was missing!

-	owl is not a cat for the extensive assistance in helping me put together
	and troubleshoot this project as it was my first custom sound bank. 
	It's greatly appreciated!

And thank you to the hardworking folks in the MM/OOT/DJ Rando community who 
enabled this technology to be possible in OoT!

Happy Listening!
